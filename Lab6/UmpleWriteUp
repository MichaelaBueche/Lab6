	Both my code and the Umple code for Lab 6 look very different. There do seem to be some similarities between them though. In my code, there is just the instantiation of the classes, the constructors, a few methods, and some variables. In the Umple code, there are many variables and methods that I did not create. These are probably suggested methods and variables that they add to all classes made through Umple. The Umple code also included the methods I created even though there is no way to add them to the Umple diagram. The Umple code also has sample code in the methods created by Umple.
	Umple is useful for large projects when you don't know what methods you are going to need, but do know the relationships and variables you will need. Umple is also useful for making coding time shorter because you can put your class relationships into Umple, and it will create suggested methods with some code already written. It could also be useful for learning the basics of designing code such as where to write certain code and how the different classes tie into each other. UML and Umple are good ways to display code because they make it easy for programmers and nonprogrammers to understand.
